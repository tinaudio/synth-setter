# Architecture Overview

High-level system overview for synth-setter. For detailed design, see the
individual design docs linked throughout.

## What This Project Does

synth-setter is a collection of tools for **synthesizer inversion** (predicting
synthesizer parameters from audio), **sound matching**, and **preset
exploration**. The system generates large-scale audio datasets by rendering
random synthesizer configurations through a VST plugin (Surge XT), trains neural
networks on these datasets, and evaluates how well the models recover the
original parameters.

 Infrastructure:
   Storage:   Cloudflare R2 (data, coordination)
   Compute:   RunPod (on-demand workers)
   Tracking:  Weights & Biases (metrics, artifacts, lineage)
   Config:    Hydra (composable YAML configs)
   Training:  PyTorch Lightning
```

## Data Flow

1. **Configure** -- Define a dataset in `configs/dataset/*.yaml` (synth, sample
   count, shard size, parameter spec).

2. **Generate** -- Workers render audio samples through Surge XT, producing HDF5
   shards uploaded to R2. Each shard contains audio waveforms, mel spectrograms,
   and ground-truth parameter arrays. Workers are fully parallel with no shared
   state.
   Design: [data-pipeline.md](design/data-pipeline.md)

3. **Finalize** -- Downloads validated shards, reshards into train/val/test
   splits (HDF5 virtual datasets or WebDataset `.tar`), computes normalization
   statistics, registers the dataset as a W&B artifact, and writes
   `dataset.complete`.
   Design: [data-pipeline.md](design/data-pipeline.md)

4. **Train** -- A single long-running job trains a model (flow matching,
   feed-forward, or FlowVAE) on the generated dataset. Checkpoints are durably
   stored in W&B via `log_model: "all"`. Hydra composes experiment configs from
   data, model, trainer, and callback configs.
   Design: [training-pipeline.md](design/training-pipeline.md)

5. **Evaluate** -- Three stages: **predict** (model inference on test data),
   **render** (synthesize audio from predicted parameters via Surge XT), and
   **metrics** (spectral and transport-based distance metrics). Results upload to
   R2.
   Design: [eval-pipeline.md](design/eval-pipeline.md)

## Key Design Decisions

**R2 as source of truth.** Pipeline state is determined by file existence and
validation in R2, not by metadata databases or coordination services. One piece
of infrastructure, one set of credentials, one failure mode. See
[data-pipeline.md](design/data-pipeline.md) section 7.1.

**Reconciliation over orchestration.** Instead of a job scheduler tracking task
state, the pipeline compares the desired state (input spec) against actual state
(validated shards in R2) to determine remaining work. Any command can be re-run
safely at any time. See [data-pipeline.md](design/data-pipeline.md) section 7.4.

**Deterministic shard identities.** Shard IDs are logical (`shard-000042`),
defined at run creation, independent of which worker or infrastructure computes
them. This makes reconciliation straightforward and results reproducible. See
[data-pipeline.md](design/data-pipeline.md) section 7.3.

**Worker isolation.** Workers are fully parallel with no shared state. Each
worker independently renders its assigned shards and uploads to R2. One worker
crashing does not affect others. See
[data-pipeline.md](design/data-pipeline.md) section 7.7.

**W&B for checkpoint durability.** Training checkpoints are uploaded to W&B
immediately via `log_model: "all"`, surviving pod death without a custom
persistence layer. See
[training-pipeline.md](design/training-pipeline.md) section 6.

**Storage conventions are shared.** All pipelines (data, training, eval) follow
the same R2 path structure and ID conventions defined in
[storage-provenance-spec.md](design/storage-provenance-spec.md).
